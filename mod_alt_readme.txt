change "mod_alt" to "mod" to replace the icons in the Pride Lands to Mahiro's cat outfit.
(rebuild game in mod manager after).
make sure to keep the default one too by changing its name.


I made the Cat Outfit version first, but I decided it would be more appropriate to use the Selfie Pose version.
But I didn't want to just get rid of it so I left it in the pack as an alternate option.
